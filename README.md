# Artistic-Pattern-Formation-using-Multi-Robot-System
This project describes the work on multi-robot pattern formation on any kind of  arbitrary target patterns with the help of optimal robot deployment, using a method  that is independent of the number of robots with having utilized the least possible  resources necessary to achieve the desired goal of non-intersecting pattern or  design formation. Generation of uniform sets of goal positions, allocation of the  multi-robots on the respective goal assignments having optimal path and fast  convergence into consideration and finally smooth deployment of robots to avoid  collisions using distributed collision avoidance methods to consequently provide a  representative set of desired patterns. In this method, the trajectories are visually  appealing in the sense of being smooth, oscillation free, and showing fast  convergence having used the reliable positioning and assignment algorithms to  generate both visually and convincing final pattern formation by optimizing the  robotsâ€™ goal positions as well as simple and smooth robot motions at the transitions  of patterns
