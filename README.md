1) delauny_voroni.py  and edgeDetection.py are python files that can be run in any IDE

2) hungarian_collision.py is python file that runs perfectly fine, but due to its 
scientific plots, many free software IDE don't support its visual outputs.

3) so we created one google colab file of hungarian and collision avoidance algorithm;
that is hungarian_collision.ipynb
it can be run on google colab, which supports scientific and advance plotting.

4) All test image files should be in the working directory

5) Do not change points text files, the program updates them automatically according to 
the assigned shape.

6) You can select the number of points that you want to keep out of canny
edge detection, in edge detetion file, other points will be eliminated.

7) You can select the number of robots also, by changing the variable number 
in hungarian file.

8) To use another image in hungarian_collision file, since we will be using another directory 
than delauny_voronoi, so update the points file manually. If all 3 files were running on 1 directory,
then it would not cause any problem.

Thank You
